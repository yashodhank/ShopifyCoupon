1.  Back End
-Created model for coupon information
-Configured Url for API
-Linked resource with API URL to associate model with the URL; configured endpoint details here, and also handled coupon creation within Shopify here.  I ran through the coupon creation process online and tracked what forms were being submitted at each step via Chromeâ€™s developer tools network activity monitor, and then reproduced those forms through post requests in the resource in order to log in and create a coupon.  I created a session to maintain the login state/authentication, then posted a login request followed by the coupon creation request.
-Tested the back end via curl and a sample JSON file:

curl --dump-header - -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST --data @testpost.txt  http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/coupon/

2.  Front End
-Created a form view to grab input parameters necessary for coupon creation.
-Registered the view with a URL/HTML.
-Once I had parsed the form params, I made a request using the API I implemented to generate the coupon in Shopify.
-Upon valid creation, returned coupon name in the view.
